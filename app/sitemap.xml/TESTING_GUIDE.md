## üìù How to Run Each Test

I've created backup versions of the route file for testing. To test each failure:

1. Backup the working version
2. Replace `route.ts` with the broken version
3. Visit /sitemap.xml in your browser
4. Observe the error
5. Restore the working version

See the broken examples in the comments below.
